Feature: Get Transfers API test


        Scenario: Get Transfers API With Auth
                Given I have tenant as "gorilla"
                When I call the auth endpoint with username: "mifos" and password: "password"
                Then I should get a valid token
                When I call the transfer API with expected status of 200
                Then I should get non empty response
                And I should have clientCorrelationId in response
